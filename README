This is a component of the rpath set of modules.  It provides
a stable interface for running background jobs, setting their status, and
seeing their result.

Note that until version 1.0 is released, public APIs are subject to
change.  All documentation regarding stable interfaces is relevant
only to published stable releases; it is not in force for alpha
and beta releases, including 0.x releases and any automated builds.

To use the latest version of the interface:
    import rpath_job
To use a specific API version of the interface:
    from rpath_job import api1 as rpath_job

API documentation is available at http://cvs.rpath.com/rpath-job-docs/
or by running "make html" and viewing docs/developer/index.html (requires
epydoc).
